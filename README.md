# Sample Project README

This is a readme file of my sample project where I will be practicing my skills. Fell free to comment. I will now pull the repo to see how git pull works.
I have now pulled this code to my vs code, I have edited it and will now push changes
I have written each and every single line of code in this repo by myself.
